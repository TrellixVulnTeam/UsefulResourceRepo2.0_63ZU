Using Postman on the web
------------------------

You can use Postman in your web browser to carry out your API development and testing tasks in conjunction with the Postman Agent. To access Postman on the web, visit [go.postman.co/home](https://go.postman.co/home). If you are using the Postman web client, you will need to also download the Postman desktop agent. You will be prompted to download and install the agent so that you can make requests from the web. You can also download the agent directly from [the Downloads page](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).

![Postman Agent](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/download-agent-v86.jpg)

The Postman agent overcomes the Cross Object Resource Sharing (CORS) limitations of browsers, and facilitates API request sending from your browser version of Postman. Once you have the agent installed you will be able to use it with web requests.

> If you try to send a request and it isn't successful because the agent is not selected, you will see a link in the response area which you can click to switch to the agent and try your request again. Read [more about the agent](https://blog.postman.com/introducing-the-postman-agent-send-api-requests-from-your-browser-without-limits/).

### [](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/installation-and-updates/#web-limitations)Web limitations

Postman on the web is under active development, but there are a few features you can currently only access in the desktop app and not in your web browser:

-   Live preview: You will not see all of your request headers update live as you enter your request configurations as you do in the desktop Postman app---you will only see Authorization headers update as you edit.
-   Saving responses to file
-   Certificates and Proxy: These will take the browser defined value and cannot be overridden by Postman.
-   Postman Interceptor

[](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/installation-and-updates/#updating-postman)Updating Postman
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The native Postman apps will notify you when a major update is available. For other updates you will see a dot on the settings icon. If the indicator is red instead of orange, it indicates a failed update.

![Update Ready](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/update-ready-v86.jpg)

Select the update option to download or install the latest update. You will see a notification when the download is complete, prompting you to restart the Postman app to apply the updates. If you're not ready to update yet, choose Later to auto-update the next time you launch the app.

You can configure your preferences to enable automatic download for major updates in Settings > Update. Postman automatically downloads minor updates and bug fixes.

![Update Ready](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/settings-updates-v86.jpg)

[](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/installation-and-updates/#postman-chrome-app-deprecated)Postman Chrome app (deprecated)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Postman Chrome app is deprecated---if you're using the Chrome app, you can [retain your data when you switch to the native app](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/installation-and-updates/#migrating-to-the-native-app) either by syncing with a Postman account you're signed into, or by exporting from Chrome and importing into the native app.

The native app is built on [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/), and [overcomes a number of restrictions](https://blog.postman.com/going-native/) of the Chrome platform.

-   The native apps let you work with [cookies](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/cookies/) directly.
-   Unlike the Chrome app, no separate extension for the [Interceptor](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/capturing-request-data/interceptor/) is needed.
-   The native apps come with a built-in proxy that you can use to [capture network traffic](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/capturing-request-data/capturing-http-requests/).
-   The native apps are not restricted by the Chrome standards for the menu bar. You can check for updates, create Postman Windows and tabs, and edit preferences.
-   The native apps let you send headers like `Origin` and `User-Agent`. These are restricted in the Chrome app.
-   The "don't follow redirects" option exists in the native apps to prevent requests that return a 300-series response from being automatically redirected---doing this in the Chrome app requires the Interceptor extension.
-   The native app has a built-in [console](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/troubleshooting-api-requests/), which allows you to view the network request details for API calls.

### [](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/installation-and-updates/#migrating-to-the-native-app)Migrating to the native app

To switch from the Chrome app to native, [download](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) Postman and [sign in to your account](https://app.getpostman.com/). Start the native app, and your history and collections will be automatically synced.

Alternatively, if you don't want to sign in to your Postman account, you can bulk export your Postman data from the Chrome app, and then bulk import into the new native app at Settings > Data.

![Import Export Data](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/export-data-v86.jpg)

> Note that importing will overwrite your existing data. For more on bulk import, see [Importing Postman data](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting-data/).

[](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/installation-and-updates/#using-postman-behind-a-firewall)Using Postman behind a firewall
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Postman's infrastructure runs on Amazon's AWS platform. If you are operating behind a network firewall, you will need to allow the following domains to make WebSocket connections for Postman:

-   `\*.getpostman.com`
-   `\*.postman.co`
-   `\*.pstmn.io`
-   `\*postman.com`

By default, WebSocket connections use the same ports as HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443).

Postman does not have a fixed IP range that can be provided. If necessary, please refer to the [current AWS IP ranges](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-ip-ranges.html) and allow the broad range provided.

[](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/installation-and-updates/#troubleshooting-your-postman-installation)Troubleshooting your Postman installation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you encounter any issues installing and running Postman, check out the following tips. If these do not help, please refer to the installation posts on the [community forum](https://community.postman.com/tags/installation) and create a new post if your issue is not already covered.

### [](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/installation-and-updates/#update-failed-error)Update failed error

If you see an Update Failed notification in Postman, you can use the DevTools to investigate.

![update-error-dialog](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/update-error-dialog.png)

Open the DevTools using View > Developer > Show DevTools (Current View). Some known errors are as follows:

-   Error message: `Cannot update while running on a read-only volume`

    -   This error means that the app user does not have write permission in the directory where Postman is installed. To resolve the problem, move Postman to a directory where the user has write permissions, for example the `/Application` directory for Mac, and to the `home` directory for Linux.

![Write Permission Issue in DevTools](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/write-permission-issue.png)

-   Error message: `Code signature at URL file:///... did not pass validation: code object is not signed at all`

    -   This error means that there are multiple updates running at the same time. This can happen when the app is opened before the previous update could finish. To resolve the problem, quit and reopen the app.

![Multiple Updates Running Issue in DevTools](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/multiple-updates-running.png)

### [](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/installation-and-updates/#update-button-not-available)Update button not available

If you are using Postman for Linux, and installed the app with the Ubuntu Software Center or Snap Store, you may not see a Check for updates button. This is because the updates are handled by the store, which should automatically update Postman on a regular cadence. If you are on Postman version 6, you will have to migrate to Postman 8 and change the Snap channel to get the latest updates. For more information see [Migrating to Postman 8](https://learning.postman.com/docs/administration/upgrading-to-v8/).

Sending your first request
==========================

You can make requests to APIs in Postman. An API request allows you to retrieve data from a data source, or to send data. APIs run on web servers, and expose endpoints to support the operations client applications use to provide their functionality.

Each API request uses an HTTP method. The most common methods are `GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`.

-   `GET` methods retrieve data from an API.
-   `POST` sends new data to an API.
-   `PATCH` and `PUT` methods update existing data.
-   `DELETE` removes existing data.

In Postman you can make API requests and examine the responses without using a terminal or writing any code. When you create a request and click Send, the API response appears inside the Postman user interface.

[![Request and response illustration](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/anatomy-of-a-request-v8.jpg)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/anatomy-of-a-request-v8.jpg)

[](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/sending-the-first-request/#sending-a-request)Sending a request
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To send your first API request, open Postman. Click the + plus button to open a new tab.

Enter `postman-echo.com/get` in the URL field.

Click Send. You will see the JSON data response from the server in the lower pane.

[![Request response](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/first-request-sent-v8.jpg)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/first-request-sent-v8.jpg)

[](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/sending-the-first-request/#next-steps)Next steps
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can use the [Postman Echo API](https://docs.postman-echo.com/) to try out test requests.

Next learn more about [sending requests in Postman](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/requests/).






Building requests
=================

You can send requests in Postman to connect to APIs you are working with. Your requests can retrieve, add, delete, and update data. Whether you are building or testing your own API, or integrating with a third-party API, you can try out your requests in Postman. Your requests can send parameters, authorization details, and any body data you require.

> For example, if you're building a client application (e.g. a mobile or web app) for a store, you might send one request to retrieve the list of available products, another request to create a new order (including the selected product details), and a different request to log a customer in to their account.

When you send a request, Postman will display the response received from the API server in a way that lets you examine, visualize, and if necessary troubleshoot it.

[![Request Sent](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/sent-request-v8.jpg)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/sent-request-v8.jpg)

If you have never sent a request before, check out [sending your first request](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/sending-the-first-request/) before you continue.

[](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/requests/#creating-requests)Creating requests
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Your requests can include multiple details determining the data Postman will send to the API you are working with. At the very least you will need to enter a URL and choose a method, but you can optionally specify a variety of other details.

You can create a new request from the Postman launch screen, using New > Request, or by clicking the + button to open a new tab.

[![New Screen](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/new-request-v8-2.jpg)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/new-request-v8-2.jpg)

> When using the launch screen or New button, you can first give your request a name and description, and choose / create a collection to save it in. Save to create your request. It will open in a new tab.

![Save Request](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/request-detail-v8.jpg)

Once your new tab is open, you can specify the details you need for your request.

[![New Request](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/empty-request-v8.jpg)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/empty-request-v8.jpg)

[](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/requests/#adding-request-detail)Adding request detail
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have a request you want to run, you will need to know the URL, method, and other optional values such as auth and parameters.

If you are just trying out sending requests in Postman, you can set the URL to the Postman Echo sample API endpoint `https://postman-echo.com/get` and the method to `GET`, then click Send to see what happens.

> Open the Bootcamp in Postman and follow Designing and mocking APIs to import some requests you can use for exploring Postman. You will find lots more sample request collections using New > Templates.

### [](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/requests/#setting-request-urls)Setting request URLs

Each request you send in Postman requires a URL representing the API endpoint you are working with. Each operation you can perform using an API is typically associated with an endpoint. Each endpoint in an API is available at a particular URL---this is what you enter into Postman to access the API.

-   If you're building an API, the URL will typically be the base location plus path. For example, in the request `https://api-test-fun.glitch.me/info`, `https://api-test-fun.glitch.me` is the base URL, and `/info` is the endpoint path.
-   If you're using a third-party API, your API provider will supply the URLs you need, for example within their developer documentation.

When you start typing in the URL input field, Postman will present a drop-down of previously used locations you can use to autocomplete.

> Enter `https://postman-echo.com/get` if you'd just like to try a request out.

[![Request URL](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/request-url-v8.jpg)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/request-url-v8.jpg)

> Postman will automatically add `http://` to the start of your URL if you do not specify a protocol.

You can optionally type *query* parameters into the URL field, or can [enter them in the Params tab](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/requests/#sending-parameters). If your request uses *path* parameters, [you can enter them directly into the URL field](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/requests/#sending-parameters).

> You can use [next generation URL encoding](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/requests/#encoding-your-request-urls) in your requests.

### [](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/requests/#selecting-request-methods)Selecting request methods

By default Postman will select the `GET` method for new request. `GET` methods are usually for retrieving data from an API. You can use a variety of other methods to send data to your APIs, including the following most common options:

-   `POST`---add new data
-   `PUT`---replace existing data
-   `PATCH`---update some existing data fields
-   `DELETE`---delete existing data

![Request Methods](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/request-methods.jpg)

> For example, if you're working with an API for a To Do list application, you might use a `GET` method to retrieve the current list of tasks, a `POST` method to create a new task, and a `PUT` or `PATCH` method to edit an existing task.

Postman supports a number of additional request methods by default, and you can use custom methods. Click the method drop-down, edit the method name text, and save your new method. To delete a method, hover over it in the list and select the trash icon.

![Custom method](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/create-custom-method.jpg)

> To try out the `https://postman-echo.com/get` endpoint, leave the `GET` method selected and click Send.

The same location (sometimes called "route") can provide more than one endpoint, by accepting different methods---for example, an API might have a `POST` `/customer` endpoint for adding a new customer, and a `GET` `/customer` endpoint for retrieving an existing customer.

-   If your request does not require parameters or authentication, you can go ahead and click Send to fetch a response.
-   Otherwise, specify your [parameters](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/requests/#sending-parameters) and any [body data](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/requests/#sending-body-data) you need to send to the API.
-   If you don't need to send data with your request, set up any required [authentication](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/requests/#authenticating-requests) and [headers](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/requests/#configuring-request-headers).

### [](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/requests/#sending-parameters)Sending parameters

You can send path and query parameters with your requests using the URL field and the Params tab.

-   Query parameters are appended to the end of the request URL, following `?` and listed in key value pairs, separated by `&` using the following syntax: `?id=1&type=new`
-   Path parameters form part of the request URL, and are referenced using placeholders preceded by `:` as in the following example: `/customer/:id`

To send a query parameter, add it directly to the URL or open Params and enter the name and value. *You can enter your query parameters in either the URL or UI fields and it will update elsewhere.*

[![Query Parameters](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/request-params-v8.jpg)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/request-params-v8.jpg)

> Parameters will not automatically be URL-encoded. Right-click selected text, and choose EncodeURIComponent to manually encode a parameter value.
>
> ![Encode Parameter](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/encode-param.jpg)

To send a path parameter, enter the parameter name into the URL field, after a colon, for example `:id`. When you enter a path parameter, Postman will populate it in the Params tab, where you can also edit it.

[![Path Parameter](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/path-param-v8.jpg)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/path-param-v8.jpg)

You can add descriptions to your parameters and they'll appear for anyone sharing the request (for example in your workspace) or viewing your API documentation.

[![Parameter Description](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/param-description-v8.jpg)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/param-description-v8.jpg)

> You can use the Bulk Edit option if you prefer to enter your parameters in text instead of using the UI. ![Bulk Edit](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/bulk-edit-v8.jpg)

If your request does not require body data, auth, or headers, go ahead and click Send to try it out. Otherwise, set up your [body](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/requests/#sending-body-data), [auth](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/requests/#authenticating-requests), and [headers](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/requests/#configuring-request-headers).

### [](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/requests/#sending-body-data)Sending body data

You will need to send body data with requests whenever you need to add or update structured data. For example, if you're sending a request to add a new customer to a database, you might include the customer details in JSON. Typically you will use body data with `PUT`, `POST`, and `PATCH` requests.

The Body tab in Postman allows you to specify the data you need to send with a request. You can send various different types of body data to suit your API.

> If you're sending body data, make sure you have the correct [headers](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/requests/#configuring-request-headers) selected to indicate the content type your API may need to process the received data correctly.
>
> -   For form-data and urlencoded body types, Postman will automatically attach the correct `Content-Type` header.
> -   If you use raw mode for your body data, Postman will set a header based on the type you select (e.g. text, json).
> -   If you manually select a `Content-Type` header, that value will take precedence over what Postman sets.
> -   Postman does not set any header type for the binary body type.

By default, Postman will select None---leave it selected if you do not need to send a body with your request.

Choose the data type you need for your request body---[form data](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/requests/#form-data), [URL-encoded](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/requests/#url-encoded), [raw](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/requests/#raw-data), [binary](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/requests/#binary-data), or [GraphQL](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/requests/#graphql).

#### [](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/requests/#form-data)Form data

Website forms often send data to APIs as `multipart/form-data`. You can replicate this in Postman using the `form-data` Body tab. Form data allows you to send key-value pairs, and specify the content type.

[![Form Data](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/form-data-v8.jpg)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/form-data-v8.jpg)

> You can attach files using form data. When you repeatedly make API calls that send the same files, Postman will persist your file paths for subsequent use. This also helps you run collections that contain requests requiring file upload. Uploading multiple files each with their own content type is not supported yet.

#### [](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/requests/#url-encoded)URL-encoded

URL-encoded data uses the same encoding as URL parameters. If your API requires url-encoded data, select `x-www-form-urlencoded` in the Body tab of your request. Enter your key-value pairs to send with the request and Postman will encode them before sending.

![URL Encoded Body](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/urlencoded-v8.jpg)

> There is sometimes confusion between form data and url-encoded. If you are unsure which one you need, check with your API provider.

#### [](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/requests/#raw-data)Raw data

You can use raw body data to send anything you can enter as text. Use the raw tab, and the type drop-down list to indicate the format of your data (Text, JavaScript, JSON, HTML, or XML) and Postman will enable syntax-highlighting as well as appending the relevant headers to your request.

![Body JSON](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/body-v8.jpg)

> You can set a content type header manually if you need to override the one Postman sends automatically.

You can use [variables](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/variables/) in your body data and Postman will populate their current values when sending your request.

> Select text in the editor and press CMD/CTRL + B to beautify your XML/JSON.

#### [](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/requests/#binary-data)Binary data

You can use binary data to send information you can't enter manually in the Postman editor with your request body, such as image, audio, and video files (you can also send text files).

![Binary Data](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/binary-body.jpg)

#### [](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/requests/#graphql)GraphQL

You can send GraphQL queries with your Postman requests by selecting the GraphQL tab in the request Body. Enter your code in the Query area and any variables in the GraphQL Variables section.

[![GraphQL Body](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/graphql-v8.jpg)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/graphql-v8.jpg)

Check out [Using GraphQL](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/supported-api-frameworks/graphql/) section for more information on GraphQL, including how to enable Autocomplete powered by Postman API schemas.

### [](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/requests/#authenticating-requests)Authenticating requests

Some APIs require auth details you can send in Postman. Authentication involves verifying the identity of the client sending a request, and authorization involves verifying that the client has permission to carry out the endpoint operation. Open the Authorization tab to configure your access details.

[![Request Auth](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/auth-v8.jpg)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/auth-v8.jpg)

Postman will automatically include your auth details in the relevant part of the request, for example in Headers.

For more detail on implementing different types of auth in your Postman requests, check out [Authorizing requests](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/authorization/).

Once your auth and other request details are set up, you can click Send to run your request.

### [](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/requests/#configuring-request-headers)Configuring request headers

Some APIs require you to send particular headers along with requests, typically to provide additional metadata about the operation you are performing. You can set these up in the Headers tab. Enter any key-value pairs you need and Postman will send them along with your request. As you type, Postman will prompt you with common options you can use to autocomplete your setup, such as `Content-Type`.

![Header Types](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/content-type-suggestion.jpg)

> You can save commonly used headers together in a header preset. In the Headers tab, click the Presets drop-down, and choose Manage Presets. Add each preset by providing a name, and entering the key plus value. Click Add and your preset will be available in the Presets drop-down. Selecting the preset will auto-populate the fields in your request headers. ![Header Preset](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/presets-v8.jpg) ![Select Preset](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/select-preset-v8.jpg)

#### [](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/requests/#auto-generated-headers)Auto-generated headers

![Connection Header](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/autogenerated-connection-header.jpg)

Postman will automatically add certain headers to your requests based on your request selections and settings. Click the hidden button at the top of the headers tab to see what Postman will send with your request.

![Hidden Headers](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/hidden-headers.jpg)

Hover over a header to see its detail.

![Host Header](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/autogenerated-host-header.jpg)

Postman will indicate why the header has been added.

![Encoding Header](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/autogenerated-encoding-header.jpg)

The detail will indicate how to disable or override a header value if you need to.

![User Agent Header](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/autogenerated-agent-header.jpg)

> Disabling or overriding recommended headers may make your request behave unexpectedly.

![Accept Header](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/autogenerated-accept-header.jpg)

If you need to change a header, you can do so in the relevant part of Postman, for example the Authorization tab, the request Body, Cookies for the request domain, the Settings, and in some cases directly in the Headers tab itself.

[![Token Header](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/headers-added-v8.jpg)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/headers-added-v8.jpg)

If you need to navigate to a different part of the app, Postman will show a link on the right-hand side.

If a header has been added based on your auth setup, [navigate to the Authorization tab](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/authorization/) to change it.

[![Auth Header](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/auth-header-v8.jpg)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/auth-header-v8.jpg)

To alter cookie headers, [amend the cookie setup](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/cookies/) for the domain you're sending the request to.

To disable an auto-generated header directly in Headers, uncheck its checkbox. To override an auto-generated header value, uncheck the auto-generated entry and add a separate entry for the header, listing its name in the Key field and specifying your value in the Value field.

[![Override Header](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/override-header-v8.jpg)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/override-header-v8.jpg)

If you have more than one entry for the same header, Postman will indicate which one will be overridden, prioritizing headers you have either explicitly added directly in Headers or indirectly via selections you made in the other parts of your request such as Authorization.

![Overridden Header](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/overridden-header-v8.jpg)

For `Content-Length` and `Content-Type` headers, Postman will automatically calculate values when you send your request, based on the data in the Body tab. However, you can override both values.

Once your headers and other request details are set up, you can click Send to run your request.

### [](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/requests/#using-cookies)Using cookies

You can manage Cookies for your domains from Postman. Click Cookies under the Send button. For more information, see [Managing cookies](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/cookies/).

[](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/requests/#choosing-custom-settings)Choosing custom settings
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can configure a variety of settings for Postman requests using the request Settings tab. These allow you to apply non-standard logic to your requests.

[![Request Settings](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/request-settings-v8.jpg)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/request-settings-v8.jpg)

### [](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/requests/#encoding-your-request-urls)Encoding your request URLs

Postman parses and encodes your request URL in order to maximize the chances of a successful API call. Postman encodes the characters in your URL and maps them to a representation that your API is most likely to accept. The Postman URL processor optimizes the chance of your request being effectively processed by the wide range of server implementations in use.

The processor will encode characters depending on where they occur in the URL:

| URL component | Characters to encode |
| --- | --- |
| Path | `"` `<` `>` ``` `#` `?` `{` `}` `SPACE` |
| Query | `"` `#` `&` `'` `<` `=` `>` `SPACE` |
| Userinfo | `"` `<` `>` ``` `#` `?` `{` `}` `/` `:` `;` `=` `@` `[` `\` `]` `^` | `SPACE` |

The processor will be turned on by default in your Postman app, however you can turn off encoding if you are working with an unusual server implementation. Toggle the setting on or off in your request Settings > Encode URL automatically.

> You can selectively encode parts of your URL by highlighting the text and right-clicking, then choosing EncodeURIComponent.

[](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/requests/#troubleshooting-your-requests)Troubleshooting your requests
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Postman will indicate any whitespace / potentially invalid characters in parts of your request that may not function as expected so that you can rectify your values. You will see characters highlighted in the request method, URL (including the path), parameters, headers (including your key names), and body.

![Invalid Characters](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/invalid-character-message.jpg)

If Postman is not able to send your request or does not receive a response, you will see details outlining the error.

[![Could not send request](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/invalid-char-v8.jpg)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/invalid-char-v8.jpg)

Click View in Console to see an overview of your request and identify the source of the issue.

If your request does not work as expected, check out some [troubleshooting tips](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/troubleshooting-api-requests/).

[](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/requests/#next-steps)Next steps
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once you have your request set up, click Send and examine the [Response](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/responses/).





Receiving responses
The Postman response viewer helps to ensure the correctness of API responses. An API response consists of the body, headers, and the status code. Postman organizes body and headers in different tabs. The status code and the completion time of the API call is visible next to the tabs.

The response also contains the HTTP specification default description. However, API authors can also add custom messages.

Saving responses
save response button

If a request has been saved in a collection, you can save responses for that request. Once the response has been returned, click the Save Response button. Enter a name to call your saved response. All responses saved for a request will be available as an example whenever you load the request. Click the Examples dropdown in the top right to view and select the saved examples.

access saved responses

Viewing responses
The Postman Body tab gives you several tools to help you understand the response quickly. You can view the body in one of three views - pretty, raw, and preview.

Pretty
pretty view

The pretty mode formats JSON or XML responses so they are easier to view. Nobody wants to scroll through a minified single line JSON response looking for that elusive string! Links inside the pretty mode are highlighted and clicking on them can load a GET request in Postman with the link URL. For navigating large responses, click on the down-pointing triangles (▼) on the left to collapse large sections of the response.

For Postman to automatically format the body, make sure the appropriate Content-Type header is returned. If not, you can force formatting through JSON or XML. You can force JSON formatting under the General tab in the SETTINGS modal. To do so. select "JSON" from the "Language detection" dropdown.

Finding items in responses: You can use CMD/CTRL + F to open the search bar, and CMD/CTRL + G to scroll through results.

Raw
raw view

The raw view is a large text area with the response body. It can indicate whether your response is minified.

Preview
view as preview

The preview tab renders the response in a sandboxed iframe. Some web frameworks by default return HTML errors and the preview mode is especially helpful. Due to iframe sandbox restrictions, JavaScript and images are disabled in the iframe.

You can maximize the body to occupy the whole Postman window. Use this view if you plan to work with the response for an extended period of time.

If your API endpoint returns an image, Postman will detect and render it automatically. For binary response types, you should select “Send and download” which will let you save the response to your hard disk. You can then view it using the appropriate viewer. This gives you the flexibility to test audio files, PDFs, zip files, or anything that the API throws at you.

Headers
headers tab

Headers are displayed as key-value pairs under the Headers tab. Hovering over the header name can give you a description of the header according to the HTTP spec. If you are sending a HEAD request, Postman will show the headers tab by default.

Network information
Postman will display network data when your API returns a response.

Network info

Hover over the globe icon to see the local and remote IP addresses for the request you sent.

Network info

When you make https requests, the Network information will display a padlock and will include detail of any certificate verification.

If you have SSL verification enabled in the global settings and verification fails, Postman will indicate the error in the response area. Click the link to disable verification globally and immediately run the request again. If SSL is disabled globally but enabled for your request, you will see the error and a link to open the console.

Verification error
Note that if you click Disable SSL Verification you will need to turn it back on if you want to verify certificates for future requests. To enable it globally, open Settings (click the gear icon at the top right of Postman) and use the switch in the General section. To enable it just for the current request, use the request Settings tab.

If you have SSL verification turned off and your request returns a certificate verification error, you will see the detail in the Network information pop-up.

Certificate error
For requests that return data successfully but with a certificate verification failure, the console will display a warning.

Certification warning

Response time
Postman automatically calculates the time it took for the response to arrive from the server. This is useful for some preliminary testing for performance.

Response size
Postman breaks down the response size into body and headers. The response sizes are approximate.

Cookies
Cookies sent by the server are visible in a dedicated tab. To manage cookies in Postman the native apps, use the MANAGE COOKIES modal. If you're working in the Postman Chrome app, you can use the Interceptor extension to help manage cookies.
