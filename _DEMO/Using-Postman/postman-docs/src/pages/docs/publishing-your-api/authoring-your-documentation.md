You can include information in your API documentation using [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). Postman will [populate various parts of your documentation](/docs/publishing-your-api/documenting-your-api/#including-detail-in-your-docs) from the information associated with the relevant collection. Your Markdown content can include standard structures and formatting such as headings, lists, images, links, bold / emphasis, code samples, blockquotes, and tables. You can author documentation either from the collection in Postman, or directly in the docs when viewing them in the web browser.

## Documenting with descriptions

You can add descriptions to various places within your collections and requests, and they will appear in your documentation. You can include descriptions for [collections](#describing-collections), [requests, parameters, and headers](#documenting-request-detail). You can also edit directly on the web for any documentation on a collection you have edit access to.

## Describing collections

You can include Markdown descriptions in your documentation, for collections and the requests within them.

You can add a description when you create a collection, or by selecting the collection and using the arrow button (&#9654;).

![Add Description](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/add-collection-description.jpg)

> When you include block elements, leave an empty line before and after to avoid any rendering issues.

You can also edit descriptions in the web browser when you view documentation for collections where you have edit permissions.

## Documenting request detail

You can provide a description when you create a new request or for an existing request at any time.

When you create a new request using the __New__ button, you will be prompted to provide a name and description (which can include Markdown), both of which will appear in your documentation.

<img alt="Request Description" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/new-request-detail.jpg" width="500px"/>

To add a description to an existing request, open the request in Postman and edit the request detail.

![Edit Request Description 1](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/edit-your-request-description-v8.jpg)

![Edit Request Description 2](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/edit-your-request-description-v8-2.jpg)

Descriptions will appear in the request section in your documentation.

![Request Description](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/request-description-v8-2.jpg)

### Parameters and Headers

You can add a description to the parameters and headers in your requestsâ€”for people viewing the request inside Postman (for example if you're working on a shared collection), or for anyone viewing your documentation.

![Parameter Description](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/request-param-headers-v8.jpg)

> All key-value pairs will be displayed in your documentation regardless of whether or not they're checked. You can indicate which pairs are required and which are optional in the description. Consumers of your documentation can choose which key-value pairs they want to use when they send requests to your endpoints. Users will be able to [generate code snippets](/docs/sending-requests/generate-code-snippets/) in the Postman app based on the key-value pairs they select, and a URL with those pairs will be displayed in the app.

The description will appear in your docs, in the request __Params__ and __Headers__ sections, next to the parameter or header name.

![Header Description in Docs](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/request-para-headers-v8-2.jpg)

![Header Description in Docs](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/request-param-desc-v8.jpg)

### Authorization details

You can include the type of authorization required to access your APIs in your documentation. You can add your authorization details at the collection level or at the request level. Authorization requirements added at the collection level apply to each request and will be displayed for each one in your documentation.

![Docs Link](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/Persistive+auth.jpg)

If one of your endpoints requires an authorization type that varies from the collection, you can add that authorization type to the request in the request tab, and it will be rendered in the documentation.

![Auth display](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/request-auth-v8.jpg)

## Using examples in your docs

You can include [example](/docs/sending-requests/examples/) request and response data in your collections, and they will appear in your documentation.

Any body data included in your request will appear in the endpoint section of your documentation.

![Body Data](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/request-response-body-v8.jpg)

You can also create an example to use for a request. Select **...** > **Add example**.

![Add Example](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/request-more-add-example-v8.jpg)

Create the example you want to add and select **Save**.

![Body Example](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/request-save-response-v8.jpg)

Any data you include in the example will appear on the right, in the docs example code sidebar, as the response body and headers.

Postman currently supports [various programming languages and frameworks](/docs/sending-requests/generate-code-snippets/#supported-languagesframeworks) to customize your code snippets.

Don't see your language of choice, or is there a setting missing that you'd find useful? Click **Contribute on GitHub** under the settings icon to contribute to [the open source project](https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-code-generators).

## Documentation links

You can link to headings within your generated documentation, including the introduction, requests, folders, and responses.

The links are generated from your documentation using IDs. To find a link, click the relevant section in the left sidebar and you'll see it in your browser address bar (or right-click and copy the link). You can then link directly to doc page sections using this link.

<img alt="Documentation Links" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/doc-links.jpg" width="400px"/><br/>

> You cannot link to another part of the documentation by manually creating an ID.

## Using images in docs

You can include any image you have hosted online in your documentation. Use the Markdown image syntax as follows:

```md
![Image Alt Text](https://your-image-location.com)
```

## Markdown demo collection

You can use the Postman [Markdown collection](https://documenter.postman.com/view/4630964/S1LsXVJy) to see how Markdown is rendered in documentation and the Postman app.

![markdown reference](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/Updated+Markdown+image+for+Authoring+your+docs.jpg)

You can see examples of documentation published using Postman by browsing [Teams](https://www.postman.com/explore/teams),[Workspaces](https://www.postman.com/explore/workspaces), [APIs](https://www.postman.com/explore/apis), and [Collections](https://www.postman.com/explore/collections).

1. Navigate to the [Public API Network](https://www.postman.com/explore) page or select **Explore** from the desktop or web application.
1. Select **Teams**, **Workspaces**, **APIs**, or **Collections**.
![Public API Network page](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/explore-docs-examples-v8.jpg)
1. Select a team, workspace, API, or collection to see documentation authored by others in the Public API Network.

![Template Docs](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/public-documentation-example-v8.jpg)

You can use both Postman desktop and web applications to author [Postman API documentation](https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/postman-public-workspace/documentation/12959542-c8142d51-e97c-46b6-bd77-52bb66712c9a).
