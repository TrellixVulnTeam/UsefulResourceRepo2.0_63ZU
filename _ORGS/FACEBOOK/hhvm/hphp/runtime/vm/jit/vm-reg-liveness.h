 * Traverses the unit and examines the status of regState() to determine
 * whether the VMRegs are clean or dirty at a given point. Clean VMRegs are
 * considered to be live, as they may be freely loaded (but not stored) by
 * accessors in the runtime. Dirty VMRegs are considered to be dead, as they
 * must be synced (and therefore written to) to before being loaded in the
 * runtime.
 *
 * The state of the VMRegs is necessary to produce the best memory effects for
 * IR instructions that maySync. This routine produces a mapping from each
 * instruction to a known liveness state, indicating whether the VMRegs are
 * Live, Dead, or MaybeLive. The results of the analysis are consumed in store
 * and load elimination.
