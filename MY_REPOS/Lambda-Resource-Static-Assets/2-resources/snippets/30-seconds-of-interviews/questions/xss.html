<h3 id="what-is-a-cross-site-scripting-attack-xss-and-how-do-you-prevent-it">What is a cross-site scripting attack (XSS) and how do you prevent it?</h3>
<h4 id="answer">Answer</h4>
<p>XSS refers to client-side code injection where the attacker injects malicious scripts into a legitimate website or web application. This is often achieved when the application does not validate user input and freely injects dynamic HTML content.</p>
<p>For example, a comment system will be at risk if it does not validate or escape user input. If the comment contains unescaped HTML, the comment can inject a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag into the website that other users will execute against their knowledge.</p>
<ul>
<li>The malicious script has access to cookies which are often used to store session tokens. If an attacker can obtain a user’s session cookie, they can impersonate the user.</li>
<li>The script can arbitrarily manipulate the DOM of the page the script is executing in, allowing the attacker to insert pieces of content that appear to be a real part of the website.</li>
<li>The script can use AJAX to send HTTP requests with arbitrary content to arbitrary destinations.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="good-to-hear">Good to hear</h4>
<ul>
<li>On the client, using <code>textContent</code> instead of <code>innerHTML</code> prevents the browser from running the string through the HTML parser which would execute scripts in it.</li>
<li>On the server, escaping HTML tags will prevent the browser from parsing the user input as actual HTML and therefore won’t execute the script.</li>
</ul>
