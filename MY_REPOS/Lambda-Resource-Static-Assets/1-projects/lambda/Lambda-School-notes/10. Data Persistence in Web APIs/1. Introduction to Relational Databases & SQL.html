    <h2 id="comparing-database-types">Comparing Database Types</h2>
    <p><strong>SQL:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Data is arranged in rows, columns, schemas, and tables relationality
      </li>
      <li>Very reliable and fast in retrieving data</li>
      <li>Well-defined standards to abide by</li>
      <li>Easy retrieval and storage</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>NOSQL:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Data is arranged in unstructured documents</li>
      <li>High level of flexibility with different data models</li>
      <li>
        Good for large-scale storage of unstructured data such as messaging
        data, log data, user and session data
      </li>
      <li>Lower Cost &amp; Open Source</li>
      <li>
        Scalability is easier: designed to perform exceptionally well under
        various conditions
      </li>
      <li>Better redundancy (more likely to have copies of data)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>SQLite vs The Rest</strong></p>
    <ul>

    <h2 id="relational-databases">Relational Databases</h2>
    <p><strong>Relation</strong> = List of Stuff</p>
    <p>
      <strong>One-to-one relation</strong> is where a record on one table is
      copied to another table (e.g. a user’s email being present on two tables)
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>One-to-many relation</strong> is where a record represents/is
      connected to many different records (e.g. a user may have many orders from
      a store. An order can only have one user)
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Many-to-many relation</strong> is where many records can relate to
      many other records. This requires a connecting table to reference the
      relationships between all the records(e.g. many students may have many
      different classes that they attend. A connecting table called “enrolments”
      would contain references to which students go to which classes).
    </p>
    <p><strong>Tables:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Data in rows and columns</li>
      <li>
        Column represents a field or attribute that is common to all records
      </li>
      <li>Tables normally have more rows than columns</li>
      <li>Tables have Primary Keys that uniquely identify each row.</li>
      <li>relationships with other tables are represented by Foreign Keys</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Index:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Similar to an index in the back of a book</li>
      <li>
        The index lists all the topics in a specified order and then refers to
        one or more specific records.
      </li>
      <li>
        An index creates a new data structure that refers to a specific
        table(s).
      </li>
      <li>It is stored on the database</li>
      <li>Used to speed up searching in the database</li>
      <li>Indexes can be created or dropped with no effect on the data</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>View:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A view is a virtual table created from the output of an SQL query.
      </li>
      <li>
        Views allow us to:
        <ul>
          <li>Structure data in a user-friendly way.</li>
          <li>
            Control + restrict access to the specific data/allow users to modify
            exactly what they need and no more.
          </li>
          <li>Summarise data from various tables</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
