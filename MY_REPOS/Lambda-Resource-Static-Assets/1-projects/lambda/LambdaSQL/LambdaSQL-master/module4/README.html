      ACID and Database Scalability Tradeoffs
    </h1>
    <p>
      Comparing the costs and benefits of relational and non-relational
      approaches - can we have the best of both worlds?
    </p>
    <h2 id="learning-objectives">Learning Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Understand and explain the advantages and disadvantages of traditional
        SQL databases
      </li>
      <li>Make informed decisions about alternative databases</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="before-lecture">Before Lecture</h2>
    <p>
      So far in this sprint you’ve used SQLite, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB. For
      each of these, consider the following questions:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>What was easy about using this technology?</li>
      <li>What was hard about using this technology?</li>
      <li>What more would you like to learn about it?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Write a summary in the style of a possible blog post, and bring the
      questions/discussion to class. Bonus - later on, follow up and complete a
      real blog post about different database technologies!
    </p>
    <h2 id="live-lecture-task">Live Lecture Task</h2>
    <p>
      We covered a lot of ground this week - today we’ll bring it together, both
      summarizing and resolving lingering questions. We’ll also continue the
      discussion from the before lecture activity, and explore the cutting edge
      “NewSQL” techniques in active development.
    </p>
    <p>
      As time allows, we’ll go back to practicing good old SQL. It’s important
      to have a broad awareness of the database universe, but SQL is a
      time-tested tool that has and will continue to be useful across a wide
      range of situations. It will also be the largest part of the sprint
      challenge, and likely a component of many job interviews.
    </p>
    <h2 id="assignment">Assignment</h2>
    <p>
      Practice! Go back to both your deployed PostgreSQL (Titanic data) and
      MongoDB (RPG data) instances - use
      <a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/query-documents/"
        >MongoDB queries</a
      >
      to answer the same questions as you did from the first module (when the
      RPG data was in SQLite). With PostgreSQL, answer the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>How many passengers survived, and how many died?</li>
      <li>How many passengers were in each class?</li>
      <li>How many passengers survived/died within each class?</li>
      <li>What was the average age of survivors vs nonsurvivors?</li>
      <li>What was the average age of each passenger class?</li>
      <li>What was the average fare by passenger class? By survival?</li>
      <li>
        How many siblings/spouses aboard on average, by passenger class? By
        survival?
      </li>
      <li>
        How many parents/children aboard on average, by passenger class? By
        survival?
      </li>
      <li>Do any passengers have the same name?</li>
      <li>
        (Bonus! Hard, may require pulling and processing with Python) How many
        married couples were aboard the Titanic? Assume that two people (one
        <code>Mr.</code> and one <code>Mrs.</code>) with the same last name and
        with at least 1 sibling/spouse aboard are a married couple.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="resources-and-stretch-goals">Resources and Stretch Goals</h2>
    <p>
      The assignment drilled core SQL, but <em>didn’t</em> review joins -
      revisit the RPG data, and do more joins (explicit or implicit) to make
      sure you understand how to connect data across tables.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you got the Titanic data in your MongoDB cluster - see if you can also
      answer the above questions using MongoDB!
    </p>
    <p>
      Read up on
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization"
        >database normalization</a
      >
      - a variety of formal techniques for reducing the redundancy of data
      stored in a relational database.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keep working on your written summary from the “before lecture” exercise,
      and grow it into a proper blog post. Consider focusing it on one
      particular technology or technique, and compare/contrast it with the
      alternatives.
