      NoSQL and Document-oriented databases

    <p>
      NoSQL, no worries? Not exactly, but it’s still a powerful approach for
      some problems.
    </p>
    <h2 id="learning-objectives">Learning Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Identify appropriate use cases for document-oriented databases</li>
      <li>Deploy and use a simple MongoDB instance</li>
    </ul>

      Sign up for an account at
      <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas">MongoDB Atlas</a>, the
      official hosted service of MongoDB with a generous (500mb) free tier. You
      can also explore the many
      <a href="http://mongodb-tools.com/">MongoDB tools</a> out there, though
      none in particular are recommended or required for installation (we’re
      really just checking out MongoDB as a way to understand document-oriented
      databases - it’s unlikely to become a core part of your toolkit the way
      SQLite and PostgreSQL may).
    </p>
    <h2 id="live-lecture-task">Live Lecture Task</h2>
    <p>
      Another database, same data? Let’s try to store the RPG data in our
      MongoDB instance, and learn about the advantages and disadvantages of the
      NoSQL paradigm in the process. We will depend on
      <a href="https://api.mongodb.com/python/current/">PyMongo</a> to connect
      to the database.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note - the
      <a
        href="https://github.com/LambdaSchool/Django-RPG/blob/master/testdata.json"
        >JSON</a
      >
      representation of the data is likely to be particularly useful for this
      purpose.
    </p>
    <h2 id="assignment">Assignment</h2>
    <p>
      Reproduce (debugging as needed) the live lecture task of setting up and
      inserting the RPG data into a MongoDB instance, and add the code you write
      to do so here. Then answer the following question (can be a comment in the
      top of your code or in Markdown) - “How was working with MongoDB different
      from working with PostgreSQL? What was easier, and what was harder?”
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no other required tasks to turn in, but it is suggested to then
      revisit the first two modules, rework/complete things as needed, and just
      check out with fresh eyes the SQL approach. Compare and contrast, and come
      with questions tomorrow - the main topic will be database differences and
      tradeoffs!

    <p>
      Put Titanic data in Big Data! That is, try to load
      <code>titanic.csv</code> from yesterday into your MongoDB cluster.
    </p>
    <p>
      Push MongoDB - it is flexible and can support fast iteration. Design your
      own database to save some key/value pairs for an application you’d like to
      work on or data you’d like to analyze, and build it out as much as you
      can!
