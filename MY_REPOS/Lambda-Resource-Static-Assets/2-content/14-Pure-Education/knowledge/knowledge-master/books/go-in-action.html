<li><code>init()</code> functions get called before main functions.</li>
<li>All variables in Go are initialized to their zero value. Pointer’s zero value is nil.</li>
<li>Once the main function returns, the program terminates. Any goroutines that were launched and are still running at this time will also be terminated by the Go run-time.</li>
