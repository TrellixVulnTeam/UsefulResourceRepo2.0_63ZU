<p>The book contains examples from Express 2. These will work correctly if used with Express 2 but will fail with Express 3. The code examples on GitHub have been updated to use Express 3. The examples in the book use a Twitter bootstrap file that is no longer available. This has also been updated in the code examples on GitHub. ## 05/10/13 - Hour 7 The book contains examples from Express 2. These will work correctly if used with Express 2 but will fail with Express 3.
